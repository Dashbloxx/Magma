# Introduction
Psychix is an operating system similar to UNIX, which contains code from Xv6 and Yagura. It is licensed as the MIT license.
Psychix is programmed mostly in C, because of how efficient and *perfect* it is. The goal of Psychix is to create an operating system that is as efficient as physically possible.
