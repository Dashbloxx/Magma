# Documentation
When using Psychix, you will realize that it is very similar to BSD, and Linux. That's because it is designed to be an operating system similar to UNIX/BSD operating systems.
This documentation will document how Psychix works, and how you can develop programs for Psychix.
## So, how does Psychix work?
When Psychix is built, it's kernel is combined with the GRUB bootloader. The GRUB bootloader loads the Psychix kernel, and jumps to it. The kernel may do some architecture-specific work, and then it will start the filesystem. It creates some vital directories like `/dev`, `/tmp`, `/proc`, and then it sets up the device files on `/dev`. These files allow code to open, close, read, and write to them (Read more about them [here](DEVICE.md)!) After that, the kernel will mount the vfs (virtual file system), which contains basic user-mode programs like a shell (Read more about shells [here](SHELLS.md)!), some commands that allow us to navigate through the filesystem, and our work-in-progress window system. Out of all these programs, the kernel runs a program called `init`, which initializes the rest of the basic things, and then runs the shell in a loop (Read more about them [here](DEVICE.md)!).
