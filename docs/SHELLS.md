# Shells
## What is a shell?
A shell is usually (almost 100% of the time) a command line interface, that allows you to run other programs (usually they're commands). This is very useful for managing the operating system.
## Basic shell commands
Almost all shells come with these basic commands. Before I explain these basic commands, you need to understand that all commands are just programs that are added to the system's PATH. The PATH is an environment variable that contains directories where there are programs usually meant to be used as commands. For example, the command `ls`, is actually a program stored in `/bin`. The command `cd`, however, is the only command that isn't a program, rather a command implemented in the shell.
Anyways, let's see the basic shell commands:
* `ls`, is a command that will list the files in the current directory.
* `cat`, is a command that will print out the contents of a file, using the first argument specified after `cat `. For example `cat hello.txt` will output the contents of `hello.txt`.
* `touch`, is a command that allows you to create blank files.
* `mkdir`, is a command that allows you to create directories.
