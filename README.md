# Psychix
## What is Psychix?
Psychix is an open-source implementation of UNIX. It borrows code from Xv6, and Yagura. Psychix will be in heavy development to make it something useful and more powerful than other UNIX-like operating systems.
## How to build Psychix?
Simply run `make`. That basically builds Psychix, and then you can test it by running:
```
./run.sh
```
We're basically assuming that you're running an operating system that runs using the Linux kernel, or an operating system that works nearly like UNIX.
